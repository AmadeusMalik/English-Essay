                Originally, track bikes were ridden indoors on the velodrome and primarily used for professional racing.
                Today while still used for racing, the other significant focus of the use of the track bike is by
                messengers in dense cities. The bikes are easily distinguishable from the rest of the pack, because
                unlike traditional bikes, track bikes do not come with brakes. Often not being drilled with brake holes
                for later installation. The simple design allows messengers to worry less about repairs and focus on the
                job at hand. This paired with the ability to have full control over the back wheel, allows for one to
                feel “one with the bike”, as if it’s a part of you. This feeling created a cult following towards these
                bikes. That has now flourished into a full worldwide community of brakeless enthusiast. This community
                shares the goal of not conforming to authority, being that having a brakeless bike is illegal in most
                countries, and even heavily policed in Japan. The language that messengers use would seem very foreign
                to someone new. “What’s your ratio?” or “Are you going to Monster-Track this year?” are regular things
                to ask within the community. Messengers host races almost every month throughout the city called
                “Alleycats”, usually for cash prizes or gear. These events are a huge free for all. You might’ve just
                started riding and wanted to race. There will be two to four people who bike on a professional level
                there almost every time. But once the race is done, everyone enjoys the after party and enjoys each
                other company as equals. One of the older school mechanisms of communication between bike messengers is
                “rookie island” on 14th St. Union Square. Is where messengers have been hanging out between jobs for
                years. And is the unofficial town square of the community. Theres also plenty of activism in this
                community with wages, immigration classism, racism. This is such a diverse community, there’s no room
                for negativity or discrimination. The discussion of discourse community really exemplifies my ideas of a
                community. And it’s allowing me to look at things with a new perspective. It is the accumulation of
                these characteristics that make the messenger community a discourse community, allow me to expand on
                that.

            <p>Being a bike messenger is synonymous with being a lone ranger out on the frontier, it’s just you and what
                you brought with you. Independence and self-reliability are two very necessary traits if you want to
                make it as a messenger. The common goal of being self-sufficient, and only relying on yourself is shared
                by every messenger. It’s an “unspoken” that comes with the job. Also not conforming to the standards of
                society by avoiding a nine to five, not everyone wants to work in the office. But bike messengers are
                looked down on in society because people may not see it as a “real job”. Yet they order things or need
                documents from across town and who do they call? It’s a little hypocritical. Another common goal is
                being as efficient as possible with your job. The design of the bike all the way to the bag is designed
                to make your job as smooth as possible.
                <br>The language that messengers use is highly specialized. Things like “ratio”, “skid”,” roadie”. Basic
                words that someone would have to explain to an outsider. Unlike other things that evolve, this language
                has maintained the same slang for the last 20 years. Messengers and track bike riders have lots of
                respect for the O.G. riders so this is personally why I think it has stuck.

            <p><br> Monster Track is a race that’s only held once a year. It’s a race that simulates the style of
                messenger and their daily work routines by heading to locations on a manifest given to you and the
                beginning of the race. Professionals and athletes even show up to race. These races are long and can
                last well into the night. People come from literally all over the world to NYC to participate in this
                race. Some sleep on friends’ couches just to catch the race and go back home when it’s over. This is the
                one chance to prove you’re the best after all.
                <br> One group within the messenger community is “Los Deliveristas Unidos” who is striving to improve
                conditions of food app delivery workers such as Uber Eats and Doordash. They work with an organization
                called “Workers Justice Project”, which helps organize and better working conditions for gig workers and
                migrants in NYC. Together they have been fighting to raise the minimum pay for workers amid the rising
                cost of living and dangerous conditions. Having raised over thirty thousand dollars, they pooled these
                resources together and managed to change the law regarding minimum pay delivery app workers. I think
                this highlights the amount of activism available in the community well.
                The discussion of discourse community has exemplified my ideas of a community can be. Also, it helped
                open my eyes to the many different genres of communities and see how it’s almost like a web that leads
                back to the main goal in the community. And for most communities knowing the genre well will help you
                communicate efficiently. <br>
